ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m qkitzero.
I'm a full-stack engineer with experience in Go and TypeScript.
I graduated with a bachelor's degree in computer science in 2023 and am currently working on system development at a listed company in Japan.
I'm particularly interested in backend architecture and am actively learning through my work.
